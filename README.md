# Machine Test App (Flutter)

This repository contains a minimal Flutter project `lib/` directory with BLoC, repositories,
models and UI files to get you started based on the UI you provided (Login & Products screens).

## What's included
- `lib/` source files (BLoC pattern, repository, services, UI widgets)
- `pubspec.yaml` with required dependencies
- `README.md`

## Notes
- Firebase platform config files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) are NOT included.
  Add them to `android/app/` and `ios/Runner/` after creating your Firebase project.
- Run `flutter pub get` and then `flutter run` to start (after adding Firebase config files).
